# Comparative Study of Deep Learning Algorithms for the Detection of Facial Paralysis
  Recent statistical analysis indicates a notable uptick in the frequency of brain strokes in recent times. However, the conventional methods for identifying brain strokes in patients demand both skilled personnel and time, with any errors holding the potential for grave outcomes. Among the most common signs of a stroke is facial paralysis. Despite its prevalence, there exists a scarcity of effective models for detecting this particular symptom.

  In an effort to alleviate some of the challenges tied to stroke detection, this report presents a comparative examination of deep learning algorithms aimed at the efficient detection of facial paralysis. The study scrutinizes three distinct pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) – namely ResNet50, InceptionV3, and VGG-16 – to ascertain the optimal choice for identifying facial paralysis. These models were trained using datasets of facial images sourced from Kaggle.

  The evaluation process employs five different metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The findings reveal that ResNet50 outperforms the others, achieving the highest accuracy at 96.63%. In comparison, InceptionV3 achieves an accuracy of 95.38%, while VGG-16 lags slightly behind with an accuracy of 93.50%. On the whole, this research holds the promise of facilitating the creation of models that enhance both the efficiency and accuracy of facial paralysis detection within the realm of biomedical applications.
